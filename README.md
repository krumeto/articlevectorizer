# articlevectorizer
A repo to host scikit-learn APIs of long-ish text vectorisation algorithms. Currently handling Sentence Transformers, gensim's Doc2Vec and spaCy. 

This package is intended to be a demo of how one can create a scikit-learn API wrapper. 
For a more mature similar project, check (embetter)[https://github.com/koaning/embetter] by Vincent Warmerdam.
